## Instructions to browse the project :

First you need to clone or download this project from here.

https://github.com/SaurabhSinghRbz/Spotify2.0-Web-Music-Player.git

### Note :

After running it on localhost, you will not be able to see any song, you will see something went wrong because I am using my Shazam core API key. So you have to create your own API key first.
